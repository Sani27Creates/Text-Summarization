# Text-Summarization
This code is a Streamlit-based text summarizer app that uses NLTK for natural language processing. It allows users to input text and specify the number of summary sentences. The app removes common words, calculates word frequencies, and scores sentences to generate a concise summary. When the "Summarize" button is clicked, the app displays the summarized text based on the input parameters.To run the project: streamlit run textsummarizer.py
